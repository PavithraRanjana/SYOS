/**
 * Domain layer containing core business entities, value objects, and enums.
 * 
 * This package follows Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles:
 * - models: Core business entities (Product, Bill, Inventory, etc.)
 * - valueobjects: Immutable value objects (ProductCode, Money, BillSerialNumber)
 * - enums: Business-related enumerations (TransactionType, StoreType, etc.)
 * 
 * All classes in this package should be free from infrastructure concerns
 * and focus purely on business logic and rules.
